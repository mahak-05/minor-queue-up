## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### Deployment

### `npm run build` fails to minify

## Tests

### Notes

- use `check-prop-types` for propTypes tests.
- Customize `jsconfig` to run correctly Jest from VS Code plugin.
- Customize `jsconfig` to use src as root folder for imports.
- Customize eslint rule to specify special files to ignore imports from dev dependencies rule.
- More details about best practices could be found in my repo `react-starter-kit`.
